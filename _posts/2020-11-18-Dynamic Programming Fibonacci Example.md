I made fibonacci algorithm to practice Dynamic Programming. 

In oder to make fibonacci algorithm using Dynamic Programming, it needs to have two properties.

  1) memorization
  
  2) sub-problems have same result when input is the same
  
Therefore, I remembered fibonacci values with array. 

It can be made with two methods. Top-down and Down-top. Top-down method seems bit more difficult than drop-top so I made fibonacci with top-down method.
