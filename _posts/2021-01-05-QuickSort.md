This is QuickSort algirithm.
The main difficulty while making this code was how to arrange array left and right based on pivot. I couldn't think of solution to do that without making new array. 

but it was solved easily when i set pivot right end of array element and compare array element from left and right and if there is something to change, just change.

Why it takes nlogn average time complexity?
